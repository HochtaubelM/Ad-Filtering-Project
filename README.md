# Ad-Filtering-Project
This project is focused on filtering advertisements on web pages. The dataset contains possible ads on websites, with features coding the image positions, phrases in the URL, anchor text, and words next to the anchor. The task is to predict whether a page contains an advertisement ("ad") or not ("nonad").
